# GraphQL Character Queries

This folder contains GraphQL queries used to fetch specific Rick and Morty characters by ID (1–4).  
Each query retrieves the following fields: **id, name, status, species, type, gender** using the `character(id: ID!)` field.

All queries were executed using the Rick and Morty GraphQL endpoint:

```
https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql
```

The JSON output files contain the exact responses returned by the API.
